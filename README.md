# Dental-Loop-Real-time-Facial-Landmark-Tracking-for-Clinical-Research

Dental Loop is a Python-based facial landmark detection application for dental research. It uses computer vision techniques to analyze real-time or stored videos of human faces, extracting measurements from facial landmarks. The application tracks and detects various facial landmark points, generating statistical and graphical outputs. These outputs aid in the accurate analysis and diagnosis of facial abnormalities and dental issues. Dental Loop offers front and side view processing, unit conversion, and organized data storage for efficient data management.
